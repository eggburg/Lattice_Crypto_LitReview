# Overview

The purpose of this report is to document the literature search findings, my reflection, and establish a landscape of the research trend on lattice cryptography in the past 10 years. Inspired by my preferred career path and job postings of particular interest, my research activities have primarily focused on 2 separate directions of lattice research: (a) implementation techniques of lattice-based crypto schemes, and (b) lattice-based zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). In the following sections, I outline and discuss my understanding and take-aways from the readings. 

Lattice cryptography is one of the most popular areas of post-quantum cryptography. The security of lattice cryptosystems is based on the lattice problems, which are immune to any known attacks that utilize quantum computers. Thus, in recent years, there has been a strong interest in lattice cryptography.

The document is structured as follows: Section 2 will provide some background knowledge of lattice, LWE, and RLWE, which are relevant to the rest of this document. Section 3 and 4 document my findings for RLWE research trends related to implementation and ZKP respectively. Section 5 will outline some remaining questions about RLWE hardness reduction. Finally, Section 6 is my reflection about this literature research project.

This document will be uploaded onto my github link at https://github.com/eggburg/Lattice_Crypto_LitReview.
